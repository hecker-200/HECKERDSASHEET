## 📌 What is this?

Yeh repo mera personal DSA grind sheet hai. Yahaan wohi problems add honge jo:
- Concept pakka karein (not just copy-paste karne layak ho)
- Code + edge case + intuition sab clear karein
- Mere weak points ko target karein (math, sliding window, linked list — tu dekhte reh)

---

## 🚀 Goals

- 🔢 Master 100+ quality DSA questions
- 🧠 Pattern recognition ka god ban jaaun
- 👨🏻‍💻 Crack interviews like a boss
- 🔥 Apna logic + speed dono max level tak le jaana

## 💡 Philosophy

*"Practice doesn't make perfect. Perfect practice makes perfect."*

- Quality over quantity
- Focus on patterns, not memorization
- Code clean, think cleaner
- Every problem teaches something new
